# reconcile
A rust version of the label reconciler

Learning Rust by converting a Python script to rust. If this experiment works, and I complete it, then I'll update this readme with real info.

Rust works well for this sort of project, however, the stakeholders have no interest in a Rust version so I'll mothball this for now.
